# VRC-OSC-Chat (WIP)

Allows you to send both **English** and **Arabic** Messages in VRChat. 
As of now, Arabic messeges sent by the in-game keyboard are backwards, and the the letters are not connected.

Using this software, Arabic messages are displayed properly: Words are written right to left, and letters are connected properly.

## Features
- Send messages in both **Arabic** and **Englsih**
- A **history** of all sent messages are saved per session. 
    - ***Left-clicking*** on an old message will copy it to the text box; you don't have to retype a message if someone wasn't looking.
    - ***Right-clicking*** will append an old message to what ever you have typed so far.
- An optional **auto-updater** version. This verion will automatically check for updates and prompt you, if you would like to install the latest release.


###### **NOTE**: This does not translate English to Arabic, or vice versa.

## Download & Install
1. Goto to [latest release](https://github.com/MrKhan20b0/VRC-OSC-Chat/releases/latest)
2. download either `VRCOSCCHAT.zip` or `VRCOSCCHAT_with_auto_updater.zip`
3. Extract the your chosen zip file somewhere on your machine, and run `VRCChatBox.exe`.

4. *(opitional)* You may add a shortcut to `VRCChatBox.exe` to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` if you would like the program to be visable in your start menu.

5. Make sure you have OSC enabled in VR Chat.
    - It Can be enabled in game by going to `options -> OSC -> Enable` in the radial menu.

#### `VRCOSCCHAT.zip` VS `VRCOSCCHAT_with_auto_updater.zip`
Both give the same version of VRCCHatBox.exe. However, `VRCOSCCHAT_with_auto_updater.zip` will check for updates upon startup. You will be prompted to install the updates if you would like.

This project is still a *work-in-progress*, so having the auto updater saves you the hassle of checking and manualling installing the latest release.

## Known Issues

- Long sentences in Arabic that need more than one line in VRChat message bubbles have to be read from the bottom-up. They can still be read right-to-left, though. A solution is in the works.

## Attribution

- Im using [PaciStardusts' fork](https://github.com/PaciStardust/CoreOSC-UTF8) of `CoreOSC.dll`.
It allows sending UTF8 encoded OSC messages, which is required to send Arabic characters.
The library was originally created by [Valdemar Ã–rn Erlingsson](https://github.com/ValdemarOrn/SharpOSC)
